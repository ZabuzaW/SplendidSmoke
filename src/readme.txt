Check if you got the newest version (refer to versions.txt)

- The smoke effect does not look like in the video?
> If you use any mods, try again without (vanilla). If the problem still persists, locate the problematic mod.
> Ensure that SplendidSmoke is loaded after this mod, this should fix the issue.
> In either case contact us at the Bistudio Forum or at GitHub so we can fix the issue also for others

- The smoke effects do not apply to a modded smoke grenade?
> The modded grenade probably does not inherit from the vanilla grenades.
> Contact us at the Bistudio Forum or at GitHub so we can add support for this mod
